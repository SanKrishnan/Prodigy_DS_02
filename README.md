# Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains my submission for **Task 2** of the **Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**. The goal of the task was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, and identify key patterns and relationships.

## 📌 Task Description

Perform data cleaning and EDA on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## 📂 Dataset

- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Warnings (to suppress future warnings)
- OS (for file access)

## ✅ Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Loaded train and test datasets.
   - Displayed first few records and structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates.
   - Filled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Fare`.
   - Dropped the `Cabin` column.
   - Converted data types for better processing.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created `Member` (SibSp + Parch + 1).
   - Derived `Alone` status.
   - Extracted `Title` from the `Name`.
   - Created `AgeBin` and `FareBin` using binning.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Plotted distributions using histograms and bar plots.
   - Visualized survival rates by:
     - Gender
     - Passenger class
     - Alone status
     - Age group
     - Fare group
     - Titles
   - Created a pie chart for passenger distribution by gender.

## 📊 Visualizations

All plots were generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib to observe trends and relationships among variables.
